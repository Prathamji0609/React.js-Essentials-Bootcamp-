Install Node.js and npm:
Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download and install them from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

Install Vite:
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Vite globally on your system:

lua
Copy code
npm install -g create-vite
Create a New Vite Project:
Once Vite is installed, you can create a new project. In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to create the project and run the following command:

lua
Copy code
create-vite my-react-app --template react
This command creates a new Vite project named my-react-app using the React template.

Navigate to the Project Directory:
Change your working directory to the newly created project:

bash
Copy code
cd my-react-app
Start the Development Server:
To start the development server, run the following command:

arduino
Copy code
npm install
npm run dev
This will build and serve your React application. You'll see an output in the terminal with a local development server address (usually http://localhost:3000).

Edit the React Component:
Open the src/App.jsx file in your code editor. Replace the existing code with a basic "Hello World" React component:

jsx
Copy code
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
View Your App:
After saving your changes, go to your web browser and open the development server address (http://localhost:3000 or the address shown in your terminal). You should see your "Hello World" message displayed in your React app.

That's it! You've successfully created a "Hello World" React app using Vite and React.js. You can now start building your React application by adding more components and functionality.
